<B> 1. Be athlete at secondary school </B>
<P>
During my teenage years I became a athlete and started to consider what would be next. Sport, in whatever form, is something I enjoy. But it's running and football that I'm most interested in. During my first year of high school, I went to a sports firm to participate in a young talent competition and a school field.

<B> 2. University education </B>
<P> 
At first, I wanted to apply for UPU, and I worked hard to find a way to apply whatever I thought would be the best fit for my results. At the time, I had no idea about websites and blogs that could provide me with a wealth of information. I am pleased to announce that I completed the IM110 programme at UiTM. At the moment, I was likewise really delighted to walk into the Machang campus. During my time at university, I discovered a lot of new things. Despite many obstacles, I am glad for my capacity to survive in Kelantan for five semesters.

<B> 3. HTML Assignment </B>
<P>
To be honest, I have no idea what HTML is. I had given up hope of finishing this task, but I persisted in trying to do it according to the rules. I learnt through YouTube and Google, with notes on HTML, CSS, and Javascript thrown in for good measure. Maybe the results aren't great, but I put everything I had into this website. Despite my dislike of coding, I'm excited to have the opportunity to develop a website. Sir Faizal Haini, thank you very much.
